Problem Set #2
This Problem Set is due at 11:30PM on Monday May 19th, and will be submitted on GRADESCOPE.
Note, any source codes required should be submitted in Canvas (on a separate link).
This Problem Set will be marked out of 60. There are four problems.
Please neatly HANDWRITE your solutions on standard 8 :511 paper, with your name at the top of
each solution. Ensure that you submit you solutions in one le PDF le on Gradescope. each problem
sets solution should be on in its own individual page, Gradescope will help ensure you
submit each solution under its correct problem number
While a solution must be absolutely perfect to receive full marks, I will be generous in awarding partial
marks for incomplete solutions that demonstrate progress.
So that there is no ambiguity, there are two non-negotiable rules. A violation of either rule constitutes
plagiarism and will result in you receiving an F for this course.
(a) If you meet with a classmate to discuss any of the Individual Problems, your submission must be
an individual activity, done in your own words, away from others. The process of nding a solution
might take 3 - 5 iterations or even more BUT you learn from all these attempts and your condence
grows with each iteration.
(b) These problem sets might seem hard on a rst look. They are designed to be so. We learn by
attempting problems, struggling through them and coming on top. I enc",2025-05-30 16:36:22.750958
